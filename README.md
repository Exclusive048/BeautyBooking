# BeautyHub

**Online booking marketplace for beauty services** — a single platform for clients, solo masters, and studios.

Clients discover specialists by category, location, and price, and book in a couple of taps — no calls, no DMs. Masters and studios get a full-featured cabinet: scheduling, client management, portfolio, analytics, and notifications.

> **Status:** MVP · Active development

## How It Works

### For clients
Browse the catalog or inspiration feed → open a provider profile → pick a service and time slot → confirm booking → get notified when the master approves.

### For solo masters
Register → fill profile and price list → configure schedule → get bookings → manage from the dashboard.

### For studios
Create a studio → invite masters by phone → assign services → manage the whole team from a shared calendar and finance view.

## Notifications

Real-time delivery via **Server-Sent Events**:

```
Client opens SSE connection → /api/notifications/stream
Server emits events via notificationsNotifier (Node EventEmitter)
```

Currently in-memory (single process). Redis client is already wired — switching to Redis Pub/Sub for multi-instance requires only one file change (`src/lib/notifications/notifier.ts`).

**Telegram bot** sends messages for all booking lifecycle events via a background worker queue with exponential retry.

- [ ] **Analytics dashboard** — booking stats, conversion, load heatmap (Premium)
- [ ] **YClients import** — one-time client base migration (Premium)
- [ ] **Gift cards** — fixed-amount certificates, email delivery
- [ ] **PWA** — full offline support, install prompt
- [ ] **AI insights** — schedule gaps, retention alerts, review auto-reply (Premium)
